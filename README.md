# 📱 Admin-User Android Application

The **Admin-User Android App** is a dual-interface mobile application designed to simplify content management and user engagement for organizations. Developed using **Java**, **XML**, and **Firebase**, this project includes two separate but interconnected Android apps:

- An **Admin App**: built for authorized personnel to manage digital content, teams, and announcements.
- A **User App**: built for general users to access shared resources, download content, and stay updated with real-time notifications.

This project demonstrates scalable architecture, real-time synchronization using Firebase, and modern Android development best practices.

## 🌟 Overview

In modern organizations and institutes, content management is often fragmented and inefficient. This Admin-User application bridges that gap by offering a streamlined platform for:

- Uploading announcements, files (eBooks, images), and media.
- Managing teams and office bearers.
- Allowing end-users to access and interact with content in real time.

The application significantly reduces content delivery delays and improves accessibility across various teams or departments.
